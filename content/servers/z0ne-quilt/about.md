## Fetch it while it's hot

The URL to the exported Zip file is {{ copy_link(url="https://z0ne.z0ne.earth/games/z0ne-quilt.zip") }}. The zip can be imported in MultiMC, PolyMC and [PrismLauncher](https://prismlauncher.org/).
My personal recommendation is the latter.

## Highlights

Quilt, a fork of Fabric, is the newest trend for Minecraft modding. 
Some very exciting mods are included, some even known from Minecraft Forge.

### Low Tech

_Auto Workstations_, _Expanded Storage_ and _Tom's Storage Mod_ allow creating rather early storage systems and automations.

### Electric

An upgraded storage system has been added with _Applied Energistics_, and extensions _AE2WT_, _Applied Botanics_ and _MEGA Cells_.

_Modern Dynamics_ and _Modern Industrialization_ are electrical mods that accompany you from start to finish.

### Mechanic

One of the favorite mods of a friend, _Create_, allows you to use mechanical powers for your contraptions.

Enjoy the scenary on a nice ~~train~~ cart ride on _Diamond Rails_!

### Magical

One of the all time classics is _Botania_, the flower mod. Also adds various flowers for a nicer ambiance.

Get more out of your crops with _Croparia_ and _Stemaria_. With these mods you can optimize your farms, and even grow ores and more!

_Sync_ allows you to create clones of yourself, and magically switch between them using the sync stations.

Teleport through dimensions with _Tempad_, no place is to far for you.

### Quality of Life

With _AppleSkin_, _Durability Viewer_, _Enchanted ToolTips_, _Inspecio_, _Jade_, _Roughly Enough Items_ and _Xaeros Minimap_ you have more information easily visible.

With _Below Bedrock Caves_ you can create your access to a specialized mining dimension. Beware: The costs of it aren't cheap.

Thanks to _Bobby_ you can "see" into previously visited chunks, for a way farther render distance. These chunks are your locally cached ones though, so they might be out of date.

_Chest Tracker_ and _Where is it_ is for easy searching through inventories your client knows about. No storage system? No problem!

Trade whole stacks worth with _Easier Villager Trading_ - easily level up your villagers.

You hear those animals in the back? Me neither, thanks to _Extreme Sound Muffler_!

_Open Parties and Claims_ lets you create your own parties and claim chunks in the game.

_Vein Mining_ adds the same named enchantment, so that you can start vein mining in the game.

Thanks to _Pack it Up_, you have backpacks in the game. They are even upgradable!

### Aesthetics

_Artisanat_ adds more block types and colors to the game.

Are the default images from minecraft boring? _Immersive Paintings_ can upload your own images into picture frames in the game.

Make your portals true portals, with _Immersive Portals_. As a side effect, you can now fall through dimensions. Starting from The End, Skylands,  Overworld, Chaos World down to the Nether.

I am not good with creating good looking structures. Thankfully _The Mighty Architect_ is there to help me.

### Exploration

Explore unknown dimensions, just take a trip through _Dimensional Doors_.

_Things_ adds many, well things to the game. Trinkets and gadgets to improve your every day life.

Level up your character with _PlayerEx_ and _RelicEx_! Search for long lost relics in the game, and spread hard earned skill points to improve your numbers! Numbers go brrrr!
